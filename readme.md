# React-Native Drink Game
For the time being, the app will only be available in German. The reason why I took a drinking game app as my first React-Native experience was that my friends once asked me if I can develop such an app for them.

### How to start
- Download Expo App for iOS or Android
- ```yarn install```
- ```expo start``` or ```expo start --tunnel```
- For seeing it in the browser: ```press w``` after expo CLI started
